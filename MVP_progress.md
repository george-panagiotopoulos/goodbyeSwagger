## Notes

### Technology Decisions
- Database: SQLite for simplicity and portability
- Application Logic: Rust for performance and safety
- API: Rust with Actix-web for consistency
- UI: React with Vite for modern development experience
- RAG: ChromaDB + OpenAI embeddings

### Development Approach
- Layer-by-layer implementation (DB → App → API → UI)
- Test-driven development where possible
- Documentation alongside implementation
- Incremental integration testing
